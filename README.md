Summary of the DriverPass Project
The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a client who wanted an efficient and user-friendly solution for scheduling driving tests and managing related services. The system needed to allow users to book appointments, select instructors, process payments, and receive confirmation notifications. It also required features to handle maintenance requests and provide clear communication with users.

What I Did Well
I excelled at creating a comprehensive UML activity diagram that detailed the process of scheduling a driving test, including error handling for unavailable time slots. This helped ensure clarity in the workflow and provided a strong foundation for both development and testing.

Revisions to Improve
If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the documentation of the maintenance process. I would expand it by incorporating more specific examples of categorization for user issues and detailing how automated updates and ticket prioritization would function. This would make the documentation even more actionable for developers and maintenance teams.

Interpreting User Needs
To interpret the user’s needs, I analyzed the requirements provided by the client, focusing on usability, efficiency, and transparency. I implemented these needs by creating features such as appointment scheduling, automated notifications, and a ticketing system for maintenance requests. Considering the user’s needs is critical because it ensures the system is practical and meets the expectations of the end-users, which ultimately determines its success.

Approach to Software Design
When designing software, I focus on gathering detailed requirements, creating clear and comprehensive diagrams, and considering the user experience at every stage. In the future, I plan to use iterative design methods like Agile to incorporate user feedback throughout the process. Additionally, I would leverage techniques such as creating wireframes and prototypes to visualize the system early and ensure alignment with the client’s goals.
